# Roadmap

Planned features for the next release (v0.8, expected Apr 2023) include the following:

* Support for external network providers (e.g. Cilium, Submariner, etc.). Or no network provider at all.
* Improved resilience and availability in cluster disconnection scenarios.
* Basic support for inter-cluster networking constraints.
